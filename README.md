# Application of Fourier Series and Newton's Convergence: 
># Predicting Local Dewpoints from Realtime Sampling of Temperature and Humidity.

Sampling temperature and humidity data using a DHT11 Sensor in order to determine local dew point temperature and analyze the local temperature trends. From the real-time data, the relationship between temperature, humidity, and partial pressure is explored through the implementation of Spectral Analysis, and identifying the stationary points of the system in a pressure domain in order to identify similar conditions within the time sample domain.
