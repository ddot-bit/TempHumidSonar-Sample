# Application of Fourier Series and Newton's Convergence: 
># Predicting Local Dewpoints from Realtime Sampling of Temperature and Humidity.
Sampling was produced by.
Exploring the relationship between temperature, humidity, and partial pressure through implementing Spectral Analysis and identifying the stationary points of the system in a pressure domain in order to idenify the same condinions in the time sample domain.
